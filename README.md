# Product Landing Page Demo 

# Description

This project creates a demo product landing page using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap.

Upon entering the site, the user lands on a demonstration page that is for a coding boot camp and has pricing based on which language the user chooses to study. There is a brief video explaining the differences between Java, Python and Javascript to help the user choose more effectively.
